1. What is the host name of the computer as reported by your linux environment? (You will need to find the right Linux command to execute for this. I suggest searching the web.)

devan-VirtualBox

2. How would you specify the name of an output file when you use the compiler if you wanted the executable to have a name other than a.out?

-o yourname

3. What happens if you type

a.out: command not found. One is trying to run an executable file the other is searching you bash profiles for some command line tool called a.out

4. What happens if you type: c++ --version 

c++ (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0

5. (AMATH 583 only). What do the -I and -l flags do in the command we used to build a.out?

-L is showing where our required linked files are (.so) and -I is telling the compiler where our include files are (.h)
